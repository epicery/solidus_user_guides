SolidusUserGuides
=================

Provides a user guide for each page on admin for quick referencing & easier onboarding of admin users.

Adding/Editing User Guides
--------------------------

The user guide text lives in `Rails.configuration.user_guides`. The entries are contextual, based on
controller_name and action_name. For instance, the entry for the `orders#index` page is located at
 `Rails.configuration.user_guides[:orders][:index]`.

 You can edit the existing definitions in an initializer. Similarly, you can also add new definitions this way.

 ```
# config/initializers/change_user_guide.rb

# Editing existing definitions
Rails.configuration.user_guides["orders"]["index"] = "Replacing old definitions"

# Adding new definitions
new_definitions = {"bah": {"humbug": "New definition"}}
Rails.configuration.user_guides.merge! new_definitions
```

Installation
------------

Add solidus_user_guides to your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'solidus_user_guides'
```

Bundle your dependencies and run the installation generator:

```shell
bundle
bundle exec rails g solidus_user_guides:install
```

Testing
-------

First bundle your dependencies, then run `bin/rake`. `bin/rake` will default to building the dummy app if it does not exist, then it will run specs. The dummy app can be regenerated by using `bin/rake extension:test_app`.

```shell
bundle
bin/rake
```

To run [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) static code analysis run

```shell
bundle exec rubocop
```

When testing your application's integration with this extension you may use its factories.
Simply add this require statement to your spec_helper:

```ruby
require 'solidus_user_guides/factories'
```

Sandbox app
-----------

To run this extension in a sandboxed Solidus application you can run `bin/sandbox`
The path for the sandbox app is `./sandbox` and `bin/rails` will forward any Rails command
to `sandbox/bin/rails`.

Example:

```shell
$ bin/rails server
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 6.0.2.1 application starting in development
* Listening on tcp://127.0.0.1:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
```

Releasing
---------

Your new extension version can be released using `gem-release` like this:

```shell
bundle exec gem bump -v VERSION --tag --push --remote upstream && gem release
```
